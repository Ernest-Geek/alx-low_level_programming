Binary to Unsigned Integer Conversion
This code provides a function binary_to_uint that allows you to convert a binary number represented as a string into an unsigned integer (unsigned int).

Function Signature
c
Copy code
unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
Function Description
The binary_to_uint function takes a pointer b to a string of '0' and '1' characters as its input. It performs the conversion from the binary representation to an unsigned integer.

The function follows the following rules:

If the input string b is NULL, the function returns 0.
If there is any character in the string b that is not '0' or '1', the function also returns 0.
Otherwise, it converts the binary representation to the corresponding unsigned integer and returns the result.
Usage Example
c
Copy code
unsigned int result = binary_to_uint("101010");
In this example, the binary string "101010" is converted to the corresponding unsigned integer value using the binary_to_uint function. The resulting value is stored in the result variable.

Compilation
To compile and use this code, make sure to include the main.h header file in your program.
